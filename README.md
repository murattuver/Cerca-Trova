# Aim of the Project
Aim of the project is to create a software version of the board game Katamino while following the design patterns covered in the course CS 319. In addition to the board game itself, new features will be implemented in this project.

# What is Katamino?
Katamino is a strategic and educational board game. It helps kids to understand geometric shapes and develops their visual perception. However, various levels of difficulties allows Katamino to be a game for people of all ages. Purpose of the game is to fill all slots with the given pieces of different shapes named pentaminos. Game gets more difficult as the number of pieces increase. It also contains a booklet showing how to set each level.

A pentomino is a part of the game which is basically the combination of 5 squares and there are 12 different pentominos in the game. How to play the game Katamino is with the given specific pentaminos, the user tries to put all the given parts to the specified 2D area called slider. The area of slider must be either a square or a rectangle. If the user succeeds to put all of the specified pentominos without any blanks, the area is considered as "Pento" and the user finishes the game. After that, the slider moves one unit and the game starts again with the new difficulty level. The game starts with a 3 x 5 slider up to 12 x 5 slider.

# Description
In our project, we will implement a Katamino game on 2D platform. The game will consist of different stages, each stage will be more difficult. We will use the solutions guide book to implement each stage. For example, we give the specific pentominos to the user and we will expect user to solve the Pento problem. 

In addition to this, we will have two modes: one of these will be called "Arcade Mode". The Arcade Mode will be more challenging and user-rewarding mode. It will have a timer, and if the user finishes before the timer stops, he/she will earn to coins to buy an extra pentomino from the item menu which consists of all kinds of pentominos, so that the user may seek an original solution, other than repeating the same approach. However, the coins will be harder to get, we assure you! Also, if you're good enough you will raise among the best in the leaderboard proving your dedication for Katamino.

The other mode is called "Normal Mode". The aim of this mode will be the offer of brain exercising for the users without driving to the competition. There will be no timer and no stress on this mode. The user can find a way to exercise his/her brain and practice for the Arcade Mode.

Also, hint system will be there for you when you need it most. It will help you to solve puzzles by giving you little tips. Despite being useful, you need to earn them by showing your best on previous levels! 

In short, we are implementing a real table game, in the perspective of PC games. We will try to use appropriate approaches of addictive games to make Katamino more interesting and more addictive. Also, we want to make a game that is more competitive, more rewarding and more aesthetic. Competitive, because people's nature is full of competition. Rewarding, because if a person has no aim to do anything, the one will lose its interest. Aesthetic, because people love the beauty with the harmony. Our game will be harmonized by the three terms and combined to serve the users. Stay tuned !
